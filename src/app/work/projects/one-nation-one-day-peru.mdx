summary: 'In 2019, over. 5,000 missionaries from across the world locked arms with 5,000 local volunteers in every state across Peru, to bring help and hope to every corner of the nation. Years of lead-up and a week of service culmniated in stadium outreaches in every state. I produced and led the video capture across the entire campaign, and edited this final recap piece.'

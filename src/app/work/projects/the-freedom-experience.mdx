summary: '1DayLA was a massive service project, with a goal to bring out 20,000 volunteers across Los Angeles to serve the city. To thank the volunteers, each one recieved a free ticket to The Freedom Experience, a Justin Beiber concert featuring Chance the Rapper, Tori Kelly, Jaden Smith, and more guest appearances. My role in this was executive producer of the capture teams, as well as lead editor on the full 2 hour broadcast and recap and promo.'
